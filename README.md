### Building

Since teki depends on SDL2, you first need to
[install the SDL2 development libraries](https://github.com/Rust-SDL2/rust-sdl2#sdl20-development-libraries).

Once SDL2 is set up, you can build and run the app simply using:

```bash
cargo run
```

### How to play (Control)

* The Arrow Keys move the character around
* Z causes a short barrage of shots to be fired; it may be held down for rapidfire
* X releases a bomb, also known as a Spell Card (presuming that any are left)
* Esc pauses the game and brings you to the in-game menu
